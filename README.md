Python For Data Analysis: Numpy and Pandas

In this hands-on project, I was able to understand the fundamentals of data analysis in Python and also the power of two important python libraries known as Numpy and pandas. NumPy and Pandas are two of the most widely used python libraries in data science since they offer high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools.
